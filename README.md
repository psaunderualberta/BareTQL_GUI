# BareTQL_GUI
A graphic user interface for BareTQL. Built under supervision of Dr. Davood Rafiei and with the support of an NSERC Undergraduate Research Grant

## Installation Instructions
Once you have cloned the repository, there are a few steps that you need to follow in order to get BareTQL GUI up and running. 
1. Download Nodejs from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). Ensure that it installed correctly by typing `node -v` in a terminal
    - OPTIONAL: when running the backend, the server must be restarted every time a change is made to one of the js files. A package called `nodemon` monitors js files for changes, and automatically restarts the server every time a file is changed and saved. This step is not mandatory, but if you plan on making changes to the backend it will save you quite a lot of trouble. Type `npm install -g nodemon` in a terminal to globally install nodemon. 
1. In your favourite terminal, cd to `../BareTQL_GUI/program/server` and type `npm i` to install the dependencies for the backend. If you have `nodemon` installed (as described in the optional step above), type `npm run dev` to start nodemon and the backend server. Otherwise, type `npm run start`. If you have not created a database, you will see the error `Something went wrong with dbPath: server/data/database.db: SqliteError: unable to open database file`. 
1. Cd to `../BareTQL_GUI/program/client` and again type `npm i` to install the dependencies for the front end. Then type `npm run serve` to start up the front-end server. Running the back-end is not necessary to run the front end, as the two services communicate through API calls. However, if you plan to use the services as intended then you will need to create a database using the files and directions located at [this link](https://bitbucket.org/tlafranc/baretql/src/master/).
